<div style="text-align: justify">

👋 **Welcome!** I'm **Zhengyu Tao (陶政宇)**, a Master’s student in **Mechanical Engineering** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**.

I received my **Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation** from **Guizhou University**, where I graduated **ranked first in my major**. My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in robotics and intelligent mechanical systems.

My current research interests lie in **robotic manufacturing**, **robot navigation**, and **control systems**. I aim to develop energy-efficient, intelligent planning and control frameworks for collaborative robotic systems.
